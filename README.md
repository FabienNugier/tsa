# tsa: The Thalesians' Time Series Analysis library

## Installation

    pip install thalesians.tsa

## Overview

The Thalesians time series library is a heterogeneous collection of tools for facilitating efficient

* data analysis and, more broadly,
* data science; and
* machine learning.

The originating developes' primary applications are

* quantitative finance and economics;
* electronic trading, especially,
* algorithmic trading, especially,
* algorithmic market making;
* high-frequency finance;
* financial alpha generation;
* client analysis;
* risk analysis;
* financial strategy backtesting.

However, since data science and machine learning are universal, it is hoped that this code will be useful in other areas. Therefore we are
looking for contributors with the above backgrounds as well as

* computer science,
* engineering, especially mechanical, electrical, electronic, marine, aeronautical, and aerospace,
* science, especially biochemistry and genetics, and
* medicine.

## Scope

Currently, the following functionality is implemented and is being expanded:

* stochastic filtering, including Kalman and particle filtering approaches,
* stochastic processes, including mean-reverting (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck) processes,
* Gauss-Markov processes,
* stochastic simulation, including Euler-Maruyama scheme,
* interprocess communication via "pypes",
* online statistics,
* visualisation, including interactive visualisation for Jupyter,
* pre-, post-condition, and invariant checking,
* utilities for dealing with Pandas dataframes, especially large ones,
* native Python, NumPy, and Pandas type conversions,
* interoperability with kdb+/q.

## Teaching

The library is utilised as part of the

* M5MF48/M5MR2 Data Analysis and Machine Learning course, as taught as part of the MSc in Mathematics and Finance programme in the
Department of Mathematics of Imperial College London.
