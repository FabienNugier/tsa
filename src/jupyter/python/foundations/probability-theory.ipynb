Instead, we shall attempt to follow the example of Gerolamo Cardano (1501 &mdash; 1576), who used the game of throwing dice to work out some of the key notions in classical (as opposed to measure-theoretic) probability. Cardano had a pretty good insentive: he was notoriously short of money and kept himself solving through gambling (and chess)."
